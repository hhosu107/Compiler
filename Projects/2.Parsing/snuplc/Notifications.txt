I put scanner.cpp/scanner.h we made, and there occurs an error.
First one was tLParans/tRParens. Therefore I edited
tLParens/tRParens -> tLParen/tRParen.
And then, there occurs an another error. That is,
    CASTStringConstant() has a line:(ast.cpp 1333)
  type = tm->GetArray(strlen(CToken::unescape(value).c_str())+1,
                      tm->GetChar());.
We know that our scanner gives string constant token with escaped characters:
\' -> \\', .... etc.
Therefore we have to unescape them.
